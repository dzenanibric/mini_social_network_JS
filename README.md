# mini_social_network_JS
Mini social network in plain JavaScript.

This web application is a simulation of a mini social network in vanilla (plain) JavaScript without a database, its basic functionalities are:

-reading data from data.js
-login
-changing the profile image using local storage (the image must be in assets / images /)
-publishing posts
-maximum number of posts is 7, when the eighth is added, the oldest is automatically deleted
-a search engine that goes through posts and highlights results

The web application is completely responsive to all screen dimensions.

Technologies used:
-HTML5,
-CSS3 (+ SASS),
-JavaScript

The web application has a lot of security vulnerabilities, and there are no forbidden or allowed routes, this is because I only used vanilla JavaScript with the basics to make the basic principle easier for beginners to understand.
